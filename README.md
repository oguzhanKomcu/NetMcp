NetMcp: A Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server in C#
NetMcp is an implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, built with .NET and C#. The goal of this project is to provide a standardized communication layer between AI models and external data sources.
What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, is an open standard designed to enable AI assistants to seamlessly integrate with external systems like various data sources, business tools, and development environments. MCP aims to eliminate the need for custom code for each integration, allowing AI models to connect with the outside world in a "plug-and-play" manner. Much like how USB-C connects different devices in a standard way, this protocol serves as a universal connector for AI models.
This project provides a reference implementation of how the MCP protocol can be implemented in the .NET ecosystem.
üöÄ Key Features
Standards-Compliant: A server skeleton that adheres to the Model Context Protocol specification.
Extensible: Designed with a modular architecture for easy integration with new data sources and services.
Modern .NET: Built using the latest .NET technologies for high performance and cross-platform compatibility.
Asynchronous Architecture: Utilizes async programming from the ground up for maximum efficiency and scalability.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
.NET: A free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform.
C#: A modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting: Used for setting up and hosting console applications.
ModelContextProtocol NuGet Package: The base library for building MCP servers and clients.
‚öôÔ∏è Usage
Once the server is running, it will be ready to accept connections from MCP-compliant clients (e.g., AI agents or development tools). Clients can access the data sources or tools provided by the server through standard MCP commands.
More detailed examples and documentation on how to use and extend the project will be added.
